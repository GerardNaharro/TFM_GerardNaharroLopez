Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a system for analyzing soccer matches using artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques. The primary goals are to calculate ball possession by team and field area, and to create a live minimap representing the current state of play. The system utilizes neural networks for detecting key objects on the field (players, ball, referees), applies homography to transform camera perspectives to a 2D minimap, and calculates possession metrics in real-time.
